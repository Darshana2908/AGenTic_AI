    "## When to Build an Agent?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Unlike conventional automation, agents are uniquely suited to workflows where traditional deterministic and rule-based approaches fall short. So,  prioritize workflows that have previously resisted automation, especially where traditional methods encounter friction.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Consider the example of payment fraud analysis. \n",
    "##### A traditional rules engine works like a checklist, flagging transactions based on preset criteria. \n",
    "##### In contrast, an LLM agent functions more like a seasoned investigator, evaluating context, considering subtle patterns, and identifying suspicious activity even when clear-cut rules aren’t violated. \n",
    "##### This nuanced reasoning capability is exactly what enables agents to manage complex, ambiguous situations effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Criteria for Building an Agent:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 01 Complex decision-making: Workflows involving nuanced judgment, exceptions, or context-sensitive decisions, for example refund approval in customer service workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 02 Difficult-to-maintain rules: Systems that have become unwieldy due to extensive and intricate rulesets, making updates costly or error-prone, for example performing vendor security reviews. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 03 Heavy reliance on unstructured data: Scenarios that involve interpreting natural language, extracting meaning from documents, or interacting with users conversationally, for example processing a home insurance claim. "
